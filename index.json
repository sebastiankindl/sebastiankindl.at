[{"content":" The Challenge Predicting the physical properties of materials like Tungsten Diselenide (WSe2) usually requires Density Functional Theory (DFT). While highly accurate, DFT is computationally extremely expensive, limiting simulations to small systems and short timescales. Classical force fields, on the other hand, are fast but often fail to capture the complex quantum mechanical interactions of 2D materials.\nEstablishing the BaselineGround-truth phonon band structure and Density of States (DOS) for pristine WSe2. These vibrational properties serve as the physical benchmark for our model training.\nThe Solution In my bachelor thesis, I implemented and trained a Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) based on the MACE (Multi-Atomic Cluster Expansion) architecture.\nData Generation: Curated a high-quality dataset of atomic configurations using ab-initio methods. Model Training: Utilized equivariant neural networks to map atomic environments to potential energy surfaces. Validation: Benchmarked the model against ground-truth DFT data to ensure high fidelity in force and energy predictions. Key Results Efficiency: Achieved a speedup of several orders of magnitude compared to traditional DFT. Accuracy: Maintained \u0026ldquo;ab-initio\u0026rdquo; level precision (low MAE in energy/forces), enabling large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Scalability: Demonstrated that the model can generalize to larger supercells that were previously unreachable. Scientific Insight: Successfully modeled defect-induced changes in the material\u0026rsquo;s vibrational spectrum, which is critical for semiconductor applications.

Manually filtering through them is time-consuming and often leads to \u0026ldquo;sales fatigue\u0026rdquo; and missed opportunities. The goal was to build a system that automatically ranks leads based on their likelihood to convert, allowing the sales team to focus their energy where it matters most.\nThe Solution I developed an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict lead conversion (binary classification).\nData Engineering: Cleaned and preprocessed customer behavioral data, handling missing values and categorical encoding. Feature Engineering: Extracted insights from lead origins, website activity, and engagement metrics to create predictive features. Model Development: Evaluated several classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to find the best balance between precision and recall. Optimization: Focused on minimizing \u0026ldquo;False Positives\u0026rdquo; to ensure the sales team doesn\u0026rsquo;t waste time on cold leads. The Lead Audit DashboardA look at the final interface: The dashboard shows real-time processing, lead concentration metrics, and a detailed breakdown of strategic signals for each prospect.\nKey Results Prioritization: The model successfully identified the top 20% of leads that accounted for over 80% of potential conversions. Actionable Insights: Discovered that specific engagement triggers (e.g., time spent on the pricing page) were stronger predictors than traditional demographic data. Performance: Achieved a high AUC-ROC score, demonstrating robust discriminatory power between converting and non-converting leads.
